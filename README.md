A clean, customizable Swift alternative to [RKDropdownAlert](https://github.com/cwRichardKim/RKDropdownAlert).

RKDropdownAlert is great. It's simple and easy to use.
But...there are some problems.

First, it's written in Objective-C and any Swift developer will tell you the same thing:

![ew](DropdownAlert/Assets/ew.gif)

Second, it's not responsive. To be truly responsive, any view library **should** be written using AutoLayout.

Finally, there's a huge caveat:

> WAIT! Don't use pods if you want to customize or use the quick and easy [RKDropdownAlert show]

Developers have come to expect the convenience of Cocoapods and if you can't both customize the dropdown and download it from Cocoapods, what's the point?

That's where `DropdownAlert` comes in. Weighing in at just under 300 lines, `DropdownAlert` is _sleek_, _fully customizable_, _responsive_, and powered by [Facebook's pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop) animation library, allowing for awesome custom animations.

## Usage
